# Distributed Task Queue Design

## Overview

The Distributed Task Queue is designed to support multiple clients and workers interacting with a central task queue server. The main goals of the system are to:
- **Distribute tasks efficiently** among multiple workers.
- **Handle concurrent client requests** to add tasks.
- **Maintain high throughput** by tuning key hyperparameters.

## Architecture

The system is split into three major components:
- **Server:** Hosts the task queue, handles client requests (task submissions), assigns tasks to available workers, and updates task results.
- **Client:** Submits new tasks to the server and can query for task results.
- **Worker:** Connects to the server, retrieves tasks, processes them, and sends back the results.

### Data Flow
1. **Task Submission:** Clients serialize and send tasks to the server.
2. **Task Queuing:** The server enqueues incoming tasks into a thread-safe task queue.
3. **Task Processing:** Workers poll the server for tasks. Once a task is assigned, the worker processes it.
4. **Result Reporting:** After processing, workers send the results back to the server, which updates the task status.

## Key Modules

### 1. Configuration (`Config.h` / `Config.cpp`)
- **Purpose:** Manage and expose hyperparameters such as maximum queue size, thread pool size, network timeouts, retry limits, etc.
- **Hyperparameters include:**
  - **MaxQueueSize:** Maximum number of tasks allowed in the queue.
  - **ThreadPoolSize:** Number of concurrent threads for processing tasks.
  - **NetworkTimeout:** Duration to wait for network responses.
  - **TaskRetryLimit:** Maximum number of retries for failed tasks.
  - **HeartbeatInterval:** Interval at which workers report their status.
  - **BatchSize:** Number of tasks to process in a batch (if batching is supported).

### 2. Logging (`Logger.h` / `Logger.cpp`)
- **Purpose:** Provide centralized logging for monitoring, debugging, and performance measurement.
- **Features:** Log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR), timestamps, and file logging.

### 3. Networking (`Network.h` / `Network.cpp`)
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate network communication using sockets. It provides methods for sending and receiving serialized task messages.
- **Features:** 
  - Message framing
  - Connection handling
  - Error management

### 4. Task Management (`Task.h` / `Task.cpp`)
- **Purpose:** Define the structure of a task including task ID, data payload, and status.
- **Features:** 
  - Serialization/deserialization routines for network transfer.
  - Execution interface for task processing.

### 5. Task Queue (`TaskQueue.h` / `TaskQueue.cpp`)
- **Purpose:** Maintain the in-memory queue of tasks.
- **Features:** 
  - Thread-safe enqueue and dequeue operations.
  - Methods to update task status and result.
  - Queue management (e.g., task prioritization if needed).

### 6. Applications
- **Server (`main_server.cpp`):** Runs the central task queue server.
- **Client (`main_client.cpp`):** Provides an interface to add tasks and retrieve results.
- **Worker (`main_worker.cpp`):** Retrieves tasks, processes them, and updates results.

## Performance and Throughput

The efficiency and throughput of the system depend on:
- **Hardware capabilities:** CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
- **Hyperparameter settings:** Adjusting `MaxQueueSize`, `ThreadPoolSize`, and network parameters to handle peak loads.
- **Optimized networking:** Efficient message serialization and minimizing latency.
- **Task complexity:** Processing time per task and potential for parallel execution.

By profiling the system under load and tuning these parameters, you can achieve maximum throughput while ensuring robust and reliable task processing.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines a modular, scalable approach for building a distributed task queue in C++. The system is designed for ease of maintenance, high performance, and flexibility to adapt to varying loads through careful hyperparameter tuning.
